    <h1>Exploring Russian Interference</h1>

    <h2>Hook (Case Study)</h2>

    <h2>Setup Strategies</h2>
    <p>The largest success of the troll accounts was establishing a voice. In the world of Twitter, being heard requires establishing authenticity as a run-of-the-mill neighbor, or authority as something like a news source. The accounts identified as trolls were able to do both with frightening success, using two main strategies.
    </p>

      <h3> Establishing Authenticity </h3>
      <p>The first strategy we observed in identified troll accounts was establishing authenticity as an average American citizen with an average American voice. Russian bots used varying rhetorical strategies over time to mimic the American voice and interject divisive dialogue. In the following wordclouds, we display the most frequently used hashtags in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.
      </p>

      <img src="images/wordclouds/wordcloud_over_time.png" style="width: 800px"></img>
      <p>In 2014, just before election activity begins to stir, we see the Russian bots seek to establish themselves as authentic American accounts. Hashtags such as #Love and #USA dominate tweets in this year, as well as interesting references to music (#Itunes, #rap, #RAPCORE), famous Americans (#Kurt_Vonnegut, #SteveJobs), and emotions (#happy, #sadness, #lonely). This early setup stage— two years before the 2016 elections— indicates significant and intentional forethought on the part of the Russians as they prepared their bots to later inject divisive dialogue during the U.S. presidential election.
      </p>

      <p>In 2015, we see the Russian bots begin to publish increasingly politically charged tweets, masquerading as Americans as they react to hot topics and news in the U.S. (#SanBernardino, #Prayers4California, #GOPDebate). In 2016, the Russian bots peak in their divisive rhetoric, frequently supporting Donald Trump (#maga, #Trump2016) and antagonizing Hillary Clinton (#NeverHillary, #CrookedHillary).
      </p>

      <p>Then, even after President Trump had won the 2016 elections, Russian bots continued to pose as Americans. In 2017, we see these fake accounts slowing down their political rhetoric and instead interjecting tweets about everyday American topics— similar to the 2014 setup stage. Alarmingly, this suggests that Russian actors sought to preserve the perceived authenticity of these fake accounts in preparation for more interference attempts in the future. The U.S. must prepare to prevent this from happening once more.
      </p>

      <p>In the interactive wordcloud below, we present the hashtags used by Russian bots in the given range of time. To view the hashtags published by these fake accounts in a certain time range, drag the labeled knobs on the slider to select your desired start and end date.

                <div class='step second-step' data-width='10%' data-index='0'>
                <p>In addition to establishing the American authenticity of these fake accounts, Russian actors also sought to establish authority and power by garnering followers and posing as powerful American institutions. When looking at user popularity (in favorites vs. followers), most troll tweets fall into a dense column near the y-axis; these posts garner a lot of favorites, despite being made by users with not many followers. Many of these account pose as regular people, with handles like KarenParker93, MsM0re, and RealRobert1987.</p>

                <div class='step second-step' data-width='90%' data-index='1'>
                <p>However, we also seethere’s a band of accounts along the x-axis that do notdon’t have very popular posts, but do have many followers- and post quite a lot. This is a striking departure from where most accounts cluster along the y-axis. Interestingly, tThese low-favorited, well-followed accounts are almost all fake news accounts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class='step second-step' data-width='50%' data-index='2'>
                <p>Examining account handles shows just how targeted fake news accounts were. Many mentioned densely-populated American cities, like TodayNYCity. Some even copied names of genuine news outlets but replaced the word “news” with “new,” as in ChicagoDailyNew or DetroitDailyNew. The high follower count of these accounts testifies to their success at impersontating news outlets. </p>
                </div>
                <div class='step second-step' data-width='60%' data-index='2'>
                <p>Notice that ChicagoDailyNew and DetroitDailyNew have the exact same account description besides the location mentioned. These cookie-cutter fake news accounts suggest the systematized spread of misinformation that underlied the election interference endeavor.

       <p>As demonstrated previously, Russian interference continued after President Trump was sworn into office. This prolonged effort to influence American elections suggests that similar interventions may be in place right now in preparation for the 2020 elections. Hopefully, we'll be better prepared this time.</p>
